# Solitaire

## Build Instructions
Solitaire depends on Qt5 for it's graphics.

To build the project do the following:

```
git clone https://www.github.com/baileyn/Solitiare.git
cd Solitaire
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../Solitaire.pro
make
```

## Additional Notes
This project hasn't been testing on Windows or Mac. I'd assume it would still work, assuming Qt works, but that comes with no guarantee.
